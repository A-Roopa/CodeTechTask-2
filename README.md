Objective
The objective of this task is to utilize a labeled dataset to apply various classification algorithms, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance to determine the most suitable algorithm for the given classification task.

Key Activities

Load and Explore: Import the Iris dataset, check for missing values.
Visualize: Use pair plots and box plots to understand feature relationships.
Preprocess: Standardize the dataset features.
Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train Models: Apply Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM.
Evaluate Models: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize Results: Plot evaluation metrics for comparison.

Technology Used


Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Handling: pandas
Visualization: seaborn, matplotlib
Machine Learning: scikit-learn

Outcomes

Model Performance Metrics: A detailed comparison of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each classification algorithm.
Visualization: Graphs showing the relationships between features, distributions, and model performance metrics.
Best Model: Identification of the most suitable classification algorithm for the given dataset based on the evaluation metrics.
